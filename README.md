# Face-Detection-Python

Face Detection is the first and essential step for face recognition, and it is used to detect faces in the images. Our goal is to detect the number of faces in a sample set of images using a 50 layered ResNet and Open CV. We shall compare the final results to see which algorithm works more efficiently.

About the dataset:
	The image dataset used here is Google Image Dataset. This dataset contains about 9 million URLâ€™s to images with 15.4 million bounding boxes and 6000 object categories. The dataset is a product of a collaboration between Google, CMU, and Cornell University.
